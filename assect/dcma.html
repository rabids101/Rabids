A disclaimer is generally any statement intended to specify or restrict the scope of rights and obligations that may be exercised and enforced by parties in a legally-recognized relationship. By posting your disclaimer prominently and by having the specific legal language you need for your website, the viewer agrees to the terms of the disclaimer. This agreement should include that the visitor assumes any and all risks associated with viewing and/or using any of the information contained on your website.
